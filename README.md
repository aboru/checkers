# Checkers

A game of checkers for two players for a linux desktop. This application will
allow two players to share a console to play a game following the American rules
for checkers. The game is played by interacting with a terminal to input commands
and view the game state.

### Goals

The project goals are:

* to create a playable game of checkers
* to learn openGL
* to write AI systems
* to practice good coding standards
* to keep a grasp of c++

### Status

> version - 0.1.0 : pre-alpha

pending features:

* game configuration
* game setup
* save game capabilities
* player movement
* win checks
* game ending

### Compatibility

work but are not explicitly tested at this point. OSX and Windows are unsupported
and changes would be needed to make them work.
